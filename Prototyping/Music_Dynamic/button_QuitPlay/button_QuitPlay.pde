/* Program Documentation & Notes
 - Libraries add specific functions to ease programming burdon
 - Must add some libraries in the IDE and the code, like Minim
 - Global Varaibles on harddrive used throuhgout the program sections
 
 - Folder Name matches first-tab or MAIN Program
 - setup() executes once, sets up all libraries & variables (and objects at the advanced level)
 - draw() maniuplates variables and how CANVAS looks
 - mousePressed() and keyPressed() are example listeners, interrupts draw(), then continues draw() at that line
 
 - Once setup() is done, draw() starts looping
 - Can temporarily pause draw() with noLoop() & loop() to wait (behind booleans or interactions)
 - Note: delay() will stop the program for a specified time
 
 - Reading Code the cursor & braces
